            Gopal Subramanium (born c. 1958), is an Indian lawyer and Senior Advocate who practices primarily in the Supreme Court of India and the Delhi High Court. He also served as the Solicitor General of India from 2009-2011.
            Gopal Subramanium commenced his career with Shardul S. Shroff, who established Amarchand & Mangaldas & Suresh A Shroff & Co in Delhi in 1980. He appeared as counsel for the states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, often traveling to these states for hearings. He then worked under D. P. Wadhwa, who rose to become a judge of the Supreme Court and later under Soli Sorabjee, former Attorney General. In 1993, Mr. Subramanium was designated a Senior Advocate (the equivalent of a Queen's Counsel in the UK) suo motu by the Supreme Court, one of the youngest to be so designated in the Supreme Court's history. His varied work-experience includes:
            Acting as counsel (in 1991 - 1992) to a judicial commission headed by Justice J. S. Verma (then a judge of the Supreme Court) to inquire into security lapses leading to the assassination of Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, the former Prime Minister of India.[5]
            Acting (in 1993) as "prosecuting counsel for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)" in the trial of persons accused of setting of a series of bomb blasts in Bombay. He acted as CBI's counsel in this matter till 2012 when appeals in this trial were heard by the Supreme Court.[4]
            Acting as a special commissioner appointed by the Supreme Court in 1994-1995 to investigate into allegations on wrongful detention of persons in mental hospitals in the State of Assam.
            In 2001, he was appointed as counsel to a judicial commission headed by Justice K. Venkataswamy (a former Supreme Court judge), to inquire into sting operations carried out by a news publication to expose corruption in defence procurement transactions.[7]
            Shortly thereafter, he acted as the Special Public Prosecutor in the prosecution of accused of the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001
            <br><br>
            He has assisted the Supreme Court as Amicus curiae in many cases including Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case.[8] Along with T. R. Andhyarujina, he represented Novartis in the case Novartis v. Union of India & Others concerning evergreening of patents,[13] a case which Novartis India managing director Ranjit Shahani described as "a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options."
            In 2014, his name figured in the list of four people recommended by the collegium for appointment as Supreme court judges. However, on 25 June, he withdrew his candidature[15] following media reports which said the Central government was objecting to his appointment because of his alleged links with corporate lobbyist Nira Radia and a negative report by Central Bureau of Investigation.
            In 2015, Gopal Subramanium appeared for multimillionaire business tycoon Mr. Mohammed Nisham, for the latter's bail plea in the Supreme Court of India. The businessman from Kerala was accused of crushing to death a security guard with his Hummer SUV over delay in opening the gates of his apartment.
            On October 9, 2015, the SC bench led by Justice Dipak Misra dismissed the arguments of senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, who appeared for Nisham, saying: "When you stay in the same apartment and you run over a poor security guard… how can you expect us to give you bail?" The court added: "The accused does not seem to value the lives of the poor and destitute. But one should know poverty and the poor matter. There is pride in poverty. It teaches you." The court also shot down Subramanium's argument that Nisham had clean records. "Your not being a history-sheeter does not matter here. The manner in which this crime has been committed does matter," said the bench. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal appeared for Kerala State in this case.

            During his tenure as a law officer, Subramanium was honoured with the National Law Day Award for Outstanding Jurist, presented to him in 2009 by the President of India, for his consistent professional excellence and adherence to the highest traditions of the Bar.
            Subramanium's duties came to the fore at one of India's largest corporate litigation, by appearing on behalf of the Union of India and defended its interests in the gas dispute between Reliance India Ltd. and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. before the Supreme Court. He reckoned his calibre at the high-profile Murder case of Jessica Lal,[21] as a Special Public Prosecutor, remaining conciliatory towards the strategic angles of the case as it involved the Indian National Congress . He was instrumental in conducting "National Consultation for Strengthening the Judiciary towards Reducing Pendency and Delays" and facilitated the incorporation of a Special Purpose vehicle, "Society for Delivery of Justice and Legal Reform".
            Subramanium is a visiting professor at the University of Delhi, and was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Law (in 2013) by the Central University of Orissa, Koraput for his contributions to the development of law in India. He is also an associate member of the prestigious, 3 Verulam Buildings barristers'chamber of London. Senior counsel and noted jurist, Fali Nariman described Subramanium as a very competent advocate and lauded the introduction of bar exams, an initiative undertaken by Subramanium.
